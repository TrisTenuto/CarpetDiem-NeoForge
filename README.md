# CarpetDiem
Have you ever wanted simple patterned carpets in Minecraft but can only find incredibly detailed and artistic mods and resource packs? Then this mod is for you! Adds variants to all the current Minecraft carpet colors with simple repeating patterns that tile so that you can have any size or shape look cohesive. These carpets are designed to add visual interest to your space without distracting from the other decorations.
 
# Carpets

Each base colored carpet has a patterned variant that can be crafted by placing the associated vanilla colored carpet into a crafting table. Don't worry, if you make a mistake, any patterned carpet is also craftable into the vanilla version. 

The patterns are designed to be relatively simple but infinitely scaleable in any direction. Some are more complex than others, but all are designed in order to not take too much attention away from the overall room design.
